# Submission files not used

In this course, we were only allowed to submit two predictions to kaggle.
We ended up using the results we got after running `Short_notebook_1.ipynb` and `Short_notebook_2_MORE_FEATURES.ipynb`.
Both of these notebooks are using the TFT model for predicdting future material stock.

The files which did not make the cut are placed here.
